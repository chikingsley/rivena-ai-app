# Advanced LLM-Driven Analysis for Therapy: E2B Use Cases

When an LLM has the ability to execute code (via E2B or similar), it can perform sophisticated analyses that would be difficult to pre-program. Here are specific use cases where this becomes valuable in a therapy context:

## 1. Emotional Pattern Recognition Over Time

**Scenario:** A therapist wants to understand how a client's anxiety has fluctuated over the past 6 months in relation to life events.

```python
# LLM-generated code that would run in E2B
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
from nltk.sentiment import SentimentIntensityAnalyzer

# Analyze emotion patterns from memory data
memories_df = pd.DataFrame(memories)
memories_df['date'] = pd.to_datetime(memories_df['timestamp'])
memories_df['month'] = memories_df['date'].dt.month

# Extract anxiety levels using sentiment analysis
sia = SentimentIntensityAnalyzer()
memories_df['anxiety_score'] = memories_df['content'].apply(
    lambda x: sia.polarity_scores(x)['neg'] if 'anxious' in x.lower() or 'anxiety' in x.lower() else 0
)

# Plot anxiety trends with life events marked
plt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))
sns.lineplot(x='date', y='anxiety_score', data=memories_df)
for idx, event in enumerate(life_events):
    plt.axvline(x=pd.to_datetime(event['date']), color='r', linestyle='--', alpha=0.7)
    plt.text(pd.to_datetime(event['date']), max(memories_df['anxiety_score'])*0.8, event['description'], rotation=45)

plt.title('Anxiety Levels Over Time with Life Events')
plt.savefig('/tmp/anxiety_timeline.png')
```

**Value:** The LLM can generate this specific analysis tailored to the therapist's exact question without requiring pre-built UI components for every possible analysis type.

## 2. Topic-Emotion Connection Map

**Scenario:** Identify which topics consistently trigger specific emotional responses for targeted therapeutic intervention.

```python
# LLM would generate and execute this in E2B
import networkx as nx
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from collections import defaultdict

# Create graph of topics and emotions
G = nx.Graph()
topic_emotion_strength = defaultdict(float)

# Process memories to identify topic-emotion pairs
for memory in memories:
    topics = extract_topics(memory['content'])  # NLP function to extract topics
    emotions = extract_emotions(memory['content'])  # NLP function to extract emotions
    
    for topic in topics:
        for emotion in emotions:
            pair = (topic, emotion)
            topic_emotion_strength[pair] += 1
            
# Build graph with topics and emotions as nodes
# Edge weight = frequency of co-occurrence
for (topic, emotion), strength in topic_emotion_strength.items():
    if strength > 3:  # Only show strong connections
        G.add_node(topic, type='topic')
        G.add_node(emotion, type='emotion')
        G.add_edge(topic, emotion, weight=strength)

# Visualize the graph
pos = nx.spring_layout(G)
plt.figure(figsize=(12, 12))

# Draw nodes differently based on type
topic_nodes = [node for node in G.nodes if G.nodes[node]['type'] == 'topic']
emotion_nodes = [node for node in G.nodes if G.nodes[node]['type'] == 'emotion']

nx.draw_networkx_nodes(G, pos, nodelist=topic_nodes, node_color='blue', node_size=500, alpha=0.8)
nx.draw_networkx_nodes(G, pos, nodelist=emotion_nodes, node_color='red', node_size=500, alpha=0.8)
nx.draw_networkx_edges(G, pos, width=[G[u][v]['weight']/2 for u,v in G.edges])
nx.draw_networkx_labels(G, pos, font_size=10, font_family='sans-serif')

plt.axis('off')
plt.savefig('/tmp/topic_emotion_map.png')
```

**Value:** This creates a personalized map showing which conversation topics are most emotionally charged for the client, helping to focus therapy.

## 3. Memory Evolution Tracker

**Scenario:** A therapist wants to see how a client's memory of a traumatic event has evolved over the course of therapy.

```python
# LLM generates this custom analysis
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer
from sklearn.metrics.pairwise import cosine_similarity

# Filter memories related to the specific event
event_memories = [m for m in memories if 'car accident' in m['content'].lower()]
event_memories.sort(key=lambda x: x['timestamp'])

# Create a visualization of how the memory content has changed
contents = [m['content'] for m in event_memories]
timestamps = [m['timestamp'] for m in event_memories]
dates = [pd.to_datetime(ts).strftime('%Y-%m-%d') for ts in timestamps]

# Calculate semantic similarity between consecutive memories
tfidf = TfidfVectorizer()
tfidf_matrix = tfidf.fit_transform(contents)
similarity_scores = []

for i in range(len(contents)-1):
    sim = cosine_similarity(tfidf_matrix[i:i+1], tfidf_matrix[i+1:i+2])[0][0]
    similarity_scores.append(sim)

# Identify key emotional words and their frequency over time
emotion_words = ['scared', 'anxious', 'overwhelmed', 'calm', 'accepting', 'angry']
emotion_freq = pd.DataFrame(index=dates, columns=emotion_words)

for i, content in enumerate(contents):
    for word in emotion_words:
        emotion_freq.iloc[i][word] = content.lower().count(word)

# Plot the evolution of memory
fig, (ax1, ax2) = plt.subplots(2, 1, figsize=(12, 10))

# Plot similarity between consecutive memories
ax1.plot(dates[1:], similarity_scores, 'o-', color='blue')
ax1.set_title('Consistency of Memory Reporting Over Time')
ax1.set_ylabel('Similarity to Previous Session')
ax1.set_xticklabels(dates[1:], rotation=45)
ax1.grid(True)

# Plot emotional content evolution
emotion_freq.plot(kind='bar', stacked=True, ax=ax2)
ax2.set_title('Emotional Content in Memory Descriptions')
ax2.set_xlabel('Date')
ax2.set_ylabel('Frequency')

plt.tight_layout()
plt.savefig('/tmp/memory_evolution.png')
```

**Value:** This shows both the semantic consistency of the memory (is it changing?) and the emotional framing over time, providing insight into therapeutic progress.

## 4. Therapeutic Intervention Recommendation

**Scenario:** Based on memory patterns, suggest personalized therapeutic techniques for specific client needs.

```python
# LLM generates this analysis
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.cluster import KMeans
from sklearn.decomposition import PCA
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Extract features from memories
memories_df = pd.DataFrame(memories)
features = extract_memory_features(memories_df)  # Function to extract relevant features

# Cluster memories to identify patterns
kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=4, random_state=0).fit(features)
memories_df['cluster'] = kmeans.labels_

# Reduce dimensionality for visualization
pca = PCA(n_components=2)
principal_components = pca.fit_transform(features)
memories_df['pc1'] = principal_components[:, 0]
memories_df['pc2'] = principal_components[:, 1]

# Analyze each cluster for dominant themes and emotions
cluster_analysis = {}
for cluster in range(4):
    cluster_memories = memories_df[memories_df['cluster'] == cluster]
    dominant_topics = extract_dominant_topics(cluster_memories)
    dominant_emotions = extract_dominant_emotions(cluster_memories)
    intervention_techniques = match_techniques_to_patterns(dominant_topics, dominant_emotions)
    
    cluster_analysis[cluster] = {
        'topics': dominant_topics,
        'emotions': dominant_emotions,
        'recommended_techniques': intervention_techniques
    }

# Visualize clusters and output recommendations
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 8))
for cluster in range(4):
    cluster_data = memories_df[memories_df['cluster'] == cluster]
    plt.scatter(cluster_data['pc1'], cluster_data['pc2'], label=f'Cluster {cluster}')

plt.title('Memory Clusters for Targeted Intervention')
plt.legend()
plt.savefig('/tmp/intervention_clusters.png')

# Return detailed recommendations
return {
    'visualization': '/tmp/intervention_clusters.png',
    'recommendations': cluster_analysis
}
```

**Value:** This provides therapists with data-driven intervention suggestions based on detailed analysis of memory patterns that would be difficult to pre-program.

## Why These Examples Need E2B-Like Functionality

These analyses are valuable because:

1. **Dynamic Generation**: The LLM generates specific analyses based on the exact question asked
2. **Personalization**: Each analysis is customized to the specific client's data patterns
3. **Complexity**: The analyses combine multiple techniques (NLP, clustering, visualization) that would be difficult to build into fixed UI components
4. **Evolution**: As therapy progresses, new types of analyses might become relevant

Without a code execution environment like E2B, you would need to anticipate and build every possible analysis type beforehand, which is impractical for the infinite variety of questions a therapist might want to ask about client data.

Would you like me to explore any of these examples in more depth, or discuss how they might be implemented in your specific application architecture?
